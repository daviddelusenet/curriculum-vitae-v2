    <Paragraph>
      In my spare time, I spend a lot of time playing and watching basketball. I
      can&apos;t get enough of it; basketball is just a beautiful game 🏀. I
      also enjoy skateboarding, doing yoga, and going to the gym.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      When I&apos;m not on a basketball court, skateboard or yoga mat, I&apos;m
      spending most of my time with my girlfriend and our two-year old son Eden
      👼.

      Besides all of the above, I&apos;m really into fashion and I enjoy playing
      video games once in a while.
