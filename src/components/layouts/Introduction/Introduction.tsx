    <Paragraph>
      I&apos;m a senior frontend engineer with over thirteen years of hands-on
      experience. I&apos;ve sucessfully worked in multidisciplinary teams
      containing multiple nationalities. Operating as an one-man army also
      isn&apos;t a problem for me.

    <Paragraph>
      Because of my extensive experience working at digital agencies I&apos;ve
      developed a strong eye for detail. I work fast and precise and my code is
      clean and to the point. Currently my expertise is React/Next.js in
      combination with TypeScript but I&apos;m open to exploring new
      technologies.
