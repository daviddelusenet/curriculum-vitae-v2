      I&apos;m a senior frontend engineer with over 13+ years of hands-on
      experience. I&apos;ve worked in multidisciplinary teams containing
      multiple nationalities. I&apos;m also capable delivering as an one-man
      army.

      Because of my extensive experience working at digital agencies I&apos;ve
      developed at strong eye for detail. My code is clean and to the point.
      Currently my expertise is React/Next.js with TypeScript but I&apos;m open
      to exploring new technologies.
