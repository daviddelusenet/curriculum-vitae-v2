    <Paragraph>
      Ever since I was a child I spent a lot of time behind my computer, just
      browsing the web, playing video games and downloading music. However, I
      didn&apos;t get into coding until about 2010, when I started with my study
      Communication and Multimedia Design at the University of Applied Sciences
      Amsterdam (HvA).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      During my second year it was mandatory to do an intership and I got an
      internship at a company called Atabix Solutions. This would be the place
      where I would acquire most of my basic development skills. Back in 2012,
      Atabix was a young but quickly growing company. This gave me the
      opportunity to have a lot of responsibility and to kickstart my career as
      a frontend developer.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      After working at Atabix for almost four years, it was time to wrap up my
      education by means of a graduation internship. I managed to get an
      internship at a design studio called Momkai, where I got offered a
      full-time job upon completion.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      At Momkai I started taking serious steps towards becoming an experienced
      developer. I (finally) stopped working with tools like jQuery and started
      working on projects with Backbone.js and React. After two fun years, where
      I grew both personally and professionally, it was time for a change. I
      started looking for a new opportunity and ended up at a Random Studio.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I worked at Random for about one and half years. While it was a really fun
      place to work, I noticed that I sometimes was missing a challenge in my
      day-to-day operations. Since all my jobs so far had been in the creative
      industry I wanted to try something else. This made me decide to persue a
      job in the consultancy sector and I joined an awesome company called
      Cygni.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      At Cygni I was working as a consultant frontend developer and I did one
      assignment at a company called Sportlink, which went really well. However,
      I was missing the inspiration, creativity and comradery most digital
      agencies had to offer. Because of this I left Cygni and went back to the
      creative sector: I joined code d&apos;azur as a senior frontend
      developer.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      After two fun years at code d&apos;azur I was approached for a lead role
      at Touchtribe and decided to go for it. At Touchtribe I was the lead
      developer on multiple projects which was really improving my management
      and leadership skills.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Six months after I started at Touchtribe I was promoted to a team lead.
      This basically meant I would keep the same responsibilities as before but
      I would also start leading a team of developers. In my case my team
      consisted entirely of junior developers which were a lot of fun to guide.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Although I really liked my role at Touchtribe, the projects I was working
      on didn&apos;t grant me the personal satisfaction I crave. Because of this
      I decided to apply at DEPT®, one of the best agencies in the world,
      working for the coolest clients. Luckily for me I got hired and in July
      2023 I started at DEPT® as a senior frontend developer.
