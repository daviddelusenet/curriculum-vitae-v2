      Before we started with the rebuild of the Club application we first
      developed a React UI kit which we published as a

      When I was not on an assignment or had any spare time I was working on an

      they play versus each other.

      One of the goals of this project was to learn a few new things. This meant
      I primarily tried using technologies I was not (super) comfortable with at
      the time. For the front-end I used TypeScript, React (hooks), Styled
      Components and Apollo GraphQL among others.

      The back-end is a Node.js (Express) server which exposes a GraphQL API to
      the front-end. This API uses Sequelize to communicate with a Postgres
      database.

      I&apos;ve worked on a lot of cool projects during my time at Random and
      really made the next step as a front-end developer. I became more
      proficient with React and Redux and started working with CSS-in-JS
      libraries like Styled Components.

      The first project I did at Random was the rebuild of the Video Wall PVH

      maintain. I rebuilt the Video Wall with web technologies like React and
      Styled Components. I also built a Node server using Express to communicate
      between the Video Wall and the Touch Table.

      One of my most treasured projects to date is the webshop I&apos;ve built
      for one of my favorite designers: Raf Simons. This was a relatively
      straight forward project, I used React and Styled Components for the
      front-end and Shopify for the back-end. The front-end uses the Shopify
      JavaScript SDK to communicate with the back-end, thus creating a fully
      custom shopping experience.

      sub-projects of that project. For example, I&apos;ve rebuilt the entire
      product detail page and catalog browser. This project is built with React,
      CSS Modules and Redux. I also did a lot of architectural work on this

      VanMoof was the first client I worked for while at Momkai: I built them a

      using Backbone.js and vanilla JavaScript and the styling is done with

      My favorite project I worked on at Momkai is the Master Digital Design

      this project, everything is just pure vanilla JavaScript.
